# Time-Series-Forcasting-of-Superstore-Sales-data-using-Machine-Learning---ARIMA-and-Prophet-Models
Time series analysis is a statistical method to extract meaningful statistics and predict future values using previously observed values. It is widely used for non-stationary data like economics, weather, stock price, and retail sales. We have used ARIMA and Prophet models for forecasting Superstore Sales data.

**In order to start this project we have to install some static model libraries which are helpful in running Prophet model such as -
```Python 
pip install statsmodels
pip install Cython
pip install convertdate
!pip install prophet
from prophet import Prophet
```
